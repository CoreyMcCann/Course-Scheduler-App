# Queen's Course Scheduler

A web application designed to help Queen's University students generate optimal weekly course schedules for Fall or Winter terms. The scheduler intelligently handles time conflicts, mandatory course requirements, and provides a visual weekly calendar view to help students make faster enrollment decisions.

The application addresses the common challenge students face when trying to manually coordinate multiple course sections, times, and requirements. Instead of spending hours checking for conflicts and trying different combinations, students can input their desired courses and instantly see all valid schedule possibilities. This dramatically speeds up the course selection process and helps ensure students don't miss enrollment deadlines due to scheduling conflicts.

## Key Features & Tips

### üéØ **Smart Schedule Generation**
- **Full Weekly Schedules**: Generate complete Monday-Friday schedules with all course meeting times
- **Conflict Detection**: Automatically identifies and eliminates schedules with time conflicts
- **Visual Calendar View**: See your schedules in a familiar weekly calendar format with color-coded courses

### üìö **Mandatory Course Logic**
The scheduler includes sophisticated handling for mandatory courses:
- **Mark courses as mandatory** to ensure they appear in every generated schedule
- **Multiple sections support**: If a course code has multiple sections (e.g., COMP 206 Section 001 and Section 002), you can add both sections and mark them both as mandatory. The scheduler will include exactly one of them in each generated schedule, giving you flexibility while ensuring the course is covered.
- **Mixed requirements**: Combine mandatory and optional courses to explore different schedule possibilities

### ‚úèÔ∏è **Easy Course Management**
- **Edit Flow**: Click the edit button (‚úèÔ∏è) on any course to repopulate the input form with its details. The "Add Course" button becomes "Update Course" for seamless editing.
- **Multiple Meeting Times**: Add courses that meet multiple times per week (e.g., Monday/Wednesday/Friday lectures)
- **Rich Course Details**: Include section numbers, course types, instructors, and locations

### ‚≠ê **Schedule Organization**
- **Favorites System**: Mark your preferred schedules as favorites for easy reference
- **Email Integration**: Send schedules to yourself or others via email
- **Course Legend**: Each schedule includes a color-coded legend showing all courses and their details
